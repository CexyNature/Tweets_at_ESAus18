# A comprehensive (not really) coverage of #ESAus18 tweets

This [code](https://github.com/neilfws/Twitter/blob/master/user2018/code/R/user2018.Rmd) was created by Neil Saunders. You can find more about him in his [repo](https://github.com/neilfws), [twitter](https://twitter.com/neilfws) and [blog](https://nsaunders.wordpress.com). Neil's code was created to analyse tweets from the useR 2018 meeting. I have run his code for analysing the #ESAus18 conference hold in Birsbane, Australia. More than seven thousand tweets (i.e 7541) were collected using the `rtweet` R package
Conference organized by Ecological Society of Australia (2018), Brisbane, Australia.
